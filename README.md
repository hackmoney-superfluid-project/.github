<h1 align="center">Superfluid Project ðŸ‘‹</h1>

## What is Superfluid?
Superfluid is an asset streaming protocol that enables real time (per-second) asset transfer.

## Our idea
Automatic money streaming into a defi protocol. Specifically, weâ€™re thinking of dollar-cost-averaging into a UniswapV3 liquidity provider position. We want users to be able to visit our frontend site, connect their wallet, and start accessing defi yields without having to think. Superfluid is not only a cool protocol, it allows us to dollar cost average into the position.
